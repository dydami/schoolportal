# WeatherApp
This is my weather App
Welcome to the Weather App! This is a simple application that allows users to view the current weather conditions of a particular location. The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data.
Installation
To use the Weather App, simply clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/weather-app.git
Once you have cloned the repository, navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies using npm:

bash
Copy code
cd weather-app
npm install
Usage
To use the Weather App, you will need to obtain an API key from OpenWeatherMap. Once you have obtained your API key, create a file called .env in the root directory of the project and add the following line, replacing <your-api-key> with your actual API key:




After adding your API key, start the application using the following command:


npm start
This will start the app in development mode, and you can access it by navigating to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.
